MLS ProAdmin is a comprehensive, role-based user and data management platform designed for administrative oversight. It features a secure login system with three distinct user levels: Super Admin, Admin, and Normal User, each with specific permissions. The core of the application is a powerful user management module that allows authorized users to add, edit, delete, filter, sort, and export user data. Additionally, a dedicated 'Definitions' section provides CRUD functionality for managing key business entities such as Sponsors, Centers, Researchers, and Project Codes, again governed by user roles. The entire application is wrapped in a visually stunning, modern, and intuitive interface.
